# Multi-agent Dashboard

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard for Takt plugin (https://github.com/byseon/Takt) where we can monitor the activity of agent teams. I think the key idea is

1. Which agents have been called and what are the status (working, completed, rest) with the session id (maybe clickable).
2. activity log tab that shows which agent is doing what (which ticket). 
3. message history that shows which agent messaged what to which agent (between agent, between agent and lead/orchestrator).
4. ticket/milestone tracking that shows where we are at (milestone) and which tickets are in-progress.

## Expansion

Wondering whether this can be generalized to any use of Agent Teams in Claude Code, or even to OpenCode.
